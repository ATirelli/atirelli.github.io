# Andrea Tirelli - Personal Website

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is where I document my journey through the fascinating intersection of pure mathematics, practical computer science, and the bureaucratic wilderness of AI regulation.

## 🎭 What I Do (The Honest Version)

I help organizations navigate the EU AI Act without losing their sanity, while simultaneously pondering whether type theory can save us all from programming language chaos. It's... an interesting combination.

- **AI Compliance Whisperer**: Translating regulatory requirements into something engineers can actually implement
- **Cross-Domain Alchemist**: Mixing machine learning with biology, physics, and insurance (because why be normal?)
- **Protocol Archaeologist**: Using formal methods to prove blockchain systems work as advertised
- **Type Theory Explorer**: Making programming languages behave better through mathematical foundations

## 🎓 The Academic Collection
- **PhD in Mathematics** (where "trivial" means "I spent 3 months on this")
- **MSc in Mathematics** (fell in love with abstraction)
- **MSc in Computer Science** (discovered computers pay better than pure math)
- **BSc in Mathematics** (where it all began)

## 🔬 Current Obsessions
- Making AI audits less terrible for everyone involved
- Teaching LLMs to read papers so humans don't have to
- Proving blockchain protocols actually work (spoiler: it's complicated)
- Exploring how mathematical rigor can tame programming chaos

## 🎪 Beyond The Office
When I'm not buried in equations or compliance documents, I design elaborate treasure hunts that somehow involve differential equations. My friends haven't complained yet, which says something about either them or my ability to make math fun.

## 🌐 This Website
Built with:
- **HTML5** + **CSS3** (with gradients, because 2025)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks were harmed)
- **Mathematical precision** + **caffeinated chaos**
- **GitHub Pages** (free hosting for the win)

Features include:
- Responsive design that works on everything
- Smooth animations that don't make you dizzy
- SEO optimization (because even mathematicians need to be found)
- Actually readable content (revolutionary, I know)
